# What is the DeSo Cryptocurrency?

$Deso is the native cryptocurrency of the DeSo blockchain.  The currency is integrated within the chain and is utilized in the same way that other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin are. If you make an account on any DeSo node, you are in the process creating a cryptowallet for the $Deso cryptocoin.&#x20;

To be able to send or receive diamonds (tips) on apps or websites that run on the DeSo blockchain you need to have $Deso in your cryptowallet, and in order to engage on any DeSo node, you will also require a small amount of $DeSo in order to pay the transaction fees associated with each node. These fees are usually small fractions of a penny.
