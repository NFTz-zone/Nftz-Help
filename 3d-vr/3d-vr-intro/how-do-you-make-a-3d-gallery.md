# How do you make a 3D Gallery?

There are multiple ways to make a 3D gallery. First it's good to know how an automatic 3D gallery is been made.&#x20;



**Automatic generation of a 3D gallery**

1. First we check if you have a gallery configured with the path ‘3dspace.’
2. If you do not have a ‘3dspace’ gallery created, we check if you have set a featured gallery.
3. If you do not have a “featured gallery” we display your “created” NFTs.
4. If you did not create any NFTs, we check your “owned” NFTs.





**How do you create a 3D gallery?**

1\. Log in with your account.

2\. Press **'='** in the top-right corner of your screen.

3\. Choose '**Galleries**'.

4\. Click '**Featured**' on 'Manage gallery'.
