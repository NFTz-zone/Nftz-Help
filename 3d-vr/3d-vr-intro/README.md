# 3D/VR Intro

At NFTz we have extensive options for 3D and VR. We can show a whole gallery in 3D/VR or even an individual 3D NFT. This section focuses on how you can mint a 3D NFT and how to navigate in the 3D/VR space.  Also this section will show you how to set up a 3D NFT gallery for yourself. Even if you have not set up a gallery, NFTz will automatically create one for you based on the NFTs you own.&#x20;
