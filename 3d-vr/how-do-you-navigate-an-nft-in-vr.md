# How do you navigate an NFT in VR?

Only NFTs that have been minted in a 3D file types (.gltf, .obj, fbx) are able to be shown in 3D or in VR. These NFTs have been specifically been created for 3D or VR. Its not possible to show .jpg/.png  in 3d directly. NFTs that can be shown in 3D have a  **‘3D symbol’** in the **topright corner** of the NFT. For you to be able to use VR you also need an VR headset like the Meta Quest 2.
