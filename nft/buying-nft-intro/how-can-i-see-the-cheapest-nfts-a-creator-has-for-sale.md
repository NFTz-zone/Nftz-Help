# How can I see the cheapest NFTs a creator has for sale?

At NFTz there are multiple ways to sort the NFTs. From our personal experience the most used sorting chooses at For Sale are 'Low Min Price and 'Low Buy Price'. Even though they sound very similar there are some differences. If you are interested in a NFT project, the best place to start is at their own zone. For example if you are interested in Desomon, you can go to desomon.nftz.zone. When you know who owns the current desomons, its also possible to the page of the collectors. You can see then all the NFTs that they own. &#x20;



**Low Min Price**

This function sorts in order of **the lowest price that has been bid compared to all NFTs from the creator**. Because some NFTs also has given the option to have a Buy Now, you will sometimes see a NFT with a high Buy NFT but a very low minimum bid price. If you click on the NFT there can be a big gap between those 2 prices. An NFT with a Buy Now of 100 deso can have a minimum bid price of 1 deso. An advantage of choosing this sorting is that you can make lower bids than the actual buy now price. Its possible to get an NFT for cheaper. A disadvantage is that you might lose a bid or it wont be accepted.&#x20;



**Low Buy Price**

This function sorts in order of **the lowest buy price of all NFTs.** An advantage of the buy prices is when you choose 'Buy Now' you are directly the owner of the NFT. The prices of Buy Now tend to be higher than the minimum price that can be bid. Even though some creators set the bid price and the buy now price at the same amount. In that case it's best to choose the buy now price so you will become the owner. If you choose the minimum bid price; somebody can still choose the buy now and be faster than you. Also the owner has to accept a bid price to close the auction.&#x20;
