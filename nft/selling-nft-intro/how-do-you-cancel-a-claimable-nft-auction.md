# How do you cancel a claimable NFT?

It's possible at NFTz to cancel the claim action on any claimable NFT that you mint. This can be useful if you would prefer to sell certain NFTs rather than give them away. It's also possible to only [update the claimable NFT and keep it going](how-do-you-update-a-claimable-nft.md). You can also list[ a new claimable NFT](how-do-you-create-a-claimable-free-nft.md).&#x20;

**Update a Claimable NFT:**

1. Make sure you are logged in.&#x20;
2. Go to the corresponding NFT.
3. Choose '<mark style="color:purple;">\~Options</mark>' (on mobile go to '**details**' first)
4. Press '**Transfer**' and choose '**Start / Update Claim Auction**'
5. Press '<mark style="color:red;">Cancel</mark>'
