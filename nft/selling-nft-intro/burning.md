Whoops! you have made an error minting an NFT. You have uploaded the wrong picture, you have included the wrong text or you have minted an NFT that's already minted. It happens to the best of us.&#x20;

Don't worry though, there is a way to remove an NFT from the blockchain. This is called **Burning.** Even though the NFT will be removed from the blockchain, the post will still be visible on the blockchain. There is also an option to hide the NFT, please see [How to hide an NFT](how-to-hide-an-nft.md) if you want to know how to do so.&#x20;

Reminder: Even though the NFT is burned, you can always remint the it again. If you are interested to know how, see [How do you mint an NFT?](how-do-you-mint-sell-an-nft.md)
