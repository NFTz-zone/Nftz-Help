# How to Add traits to your NFT by extradata? \[Expert]

Some NFT projects have traits to create more value and a way to differentiate each NFT. By adding traits it will convert it into a collection with a collection name. It's possible to have 1 very big collection of NFTs, but also possible to make different collections of the same NFT series. (i.e. first season, second season, etc.) You can decide your own names for each collection. &#x20;

**How to add traits to an NFT with Json/Extradata**

1. Make sure you are logged in.&#x20;
2. Press **'='** on the top-left of your screen.&#x20;
3. Choose **'New NFT'**.
4. Click on ‘**Add extra / collection data**’ box
5. &#x20;Use ‘**Json’** to use the ‘Extradata format’
6. You can fill in the code. \[If you dont know how to do this; scroll down further on this page to see a example of code that can be used]
7. Tip 1: if you fill in the code in Json and you press **'Form'** you can see how it will look like visual.&#x20;
8. Tip 2: if you see Json NO, the code is incorrect. You should see '**Json OK'**.&#x20;
9. Tip 3: Json is case - and space sensitive. This is important to know; to prevent 'double' traits to  appear. Like '**B**ackground' and '**b**ackground'.&#x20;
10. Mint the NFT.&#x20;

**Using the default description box**

Note that we recommend to always put information about the NFT into the default description box. This is to ensure that nodes that don't show Extradata have at least the basic details of an NFT.
