**Not enough $Deso**

To make posts and make a mint you need a very tiny amount of Deso. Make sure you have $Deso in your wallet on your acount. If you have made posts in the past we might help with sending a diamond.&#x20;



**Network problems**

The network of Deso might not work as intented. Depending on the severity; relogging might work. If it worse, feel free to contact us. We can investigate the issue. &#x20;



**Node down**

If node.deso.org goes down This one is beyond your control. If the node goes down it will not be possible to make posts or make mints. Usually it is resolved in a couple of hours.
