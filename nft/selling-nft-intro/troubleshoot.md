Relogging or using the link that is mentioned above will usually solve most problems. If you keep getting error messages, dont hestitate to contact us at our socials. If this doesnt work the following things can be the problem. &#x20;



**Not enough $Deso**

To make posts and make a mint you need a very tiny amount of Deso. Make sure you have $Deso in your wallet on your acount. If you have made posts in the past we might help with sending a diamond.&#x20;



**Network problems**

The network of Deso might not work as intented. Depending on the severity; relogging might work. If it worse, feel free to contact us. We can investigate the issue. &#x20;



**Node down**

If node.deso.org goes down This one is beyond your control. If the node goes down it will not be possible to make posts or make mints. Usually it is resolved in a couple of hours. Feel free to contact us if you keep getting errors. We will investigate the issue and try to resolve this issue.&#x20;



**Can't Find the Mint Button**

The mint button is only avalailable on the PC.&#x20;



**3D NFT not showing 3D button**

These can be caused by 2 currently known issues:

My 3D NFT only shows an image or video but no 3D button.

1. The Next-Prep for Mint' button hasnt been pressed after adding an image when the 3D file has been uploaded.&#x20;
2. File types have to be written without any spaces between the letters; else the 3D file will not work in 3D mode. Example '3D NFT.GLB' wont work but '3DNFT.GLB' will work.&#x20;



**I can't find the Unlockable Content feature**

This feature was almost never used and confuses new users, so we decided to remove it to make it an easier experience. There is a workaround. It's still possible to send a direct message to a buyer of an NFT and send a file through mail or use a dropbox.&#x20;
