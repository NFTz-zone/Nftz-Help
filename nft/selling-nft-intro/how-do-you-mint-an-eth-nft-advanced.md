# How do you mint an ETH NFT? \[Advanced]

At this page we learn how you mint an NFT minted at the ethereum blockchain. This NFT will also be shown on NFTz and Rarible if you choose Lazy Mint (minting without gas costs). If you mint with gas costs your NFT will show up on all the Ethereum market places.  If you just want to mint an NFT the easiest way you can also mint at the Deso Blockchain by clicking [here](how-do-you-mint-sell-an-nft.md).&#x20;

11. Fill in '**Min Bid'**  the desired amount of Deso **or** fill in the desired amount of Deso at '**Buy Now'.** \[Only filling in Buy Now is easier if you don't know what to do]    &#x20;
