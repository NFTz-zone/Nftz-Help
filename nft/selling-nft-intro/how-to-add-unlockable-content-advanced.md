# How to add unlockable content? \[Advanced]

It's possible to add unlockable content to NFTs at NFTz. This feature is not for highly confidential files but rather high quality version(s) of an NFT, a message to NFT owners or a QR code.  It's also possible to add multiple files within the unlockable content when they are bundled in a zip file. Most file types are supported, but we recommend keeping the file size below 100MB. This feature also allows for the unlockable content to be accessed by a new owner once an NFL is sold or transferred.
