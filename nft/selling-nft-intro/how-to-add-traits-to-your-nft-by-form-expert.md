# How to add traits to your NFT by form? \[Expert]

Some NFT projects have traits to create more value and a way to differentiate each NFT. By adding traits it will convert it into a collection with a collection name. It's possible to have 1 very big collection of NFTs, but also possible to make different collections of the same NFT series. (i.e. first season, second season, etc.) You can decide your own names for each collection.&#x20;
