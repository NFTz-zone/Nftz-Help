# How to set additional royalties? \[Advanced]

When you are minting an NFT, you sometimes want to give royalties to other creators. For example, if you are doing a collaboration with another artist or if you want to sponsor somebody. DeSo gives the ability to set multiple royalties to other creators. Royalties are applied to all primary sales and all resales (second, third, fourth resale, etc.) &#x20;
