# How to mint an Audio NFT?

Users on NFTz are able to mint an album with multiple tracks attached to it as well as a cover photo. It's also possible to mint any such NFT with multiple copies. This NFT can then be sold, made [claimable](how-do-you-create-a-claimable-free-nft.md) for free, or [transferred](how-to-transfer-an-nft.md) to different user(s).&#x20;
