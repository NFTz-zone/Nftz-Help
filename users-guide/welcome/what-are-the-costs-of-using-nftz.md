# What are the costs of using NFTz?

By using NFTz on the DeSo blockchain transactions are being executed. Think of transactions like minting a NFT or giving a diamond/like to a creator. To cover our expenses for fulfilling these transactions and doing maintanance to our node we have set a transaction fee that is a small fraction of a penny. &#x20;

For the use of NFTz we have set a **** fee of **\~0.0006 $ per transaction**.&#x20;
