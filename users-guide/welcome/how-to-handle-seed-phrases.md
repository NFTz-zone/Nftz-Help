# How to handle Seed Phrases

When you create a new account on DeSo you will receive a 12-word Seed Phrase.  This phrase is basically the private key to your DeSo account and $Deso wallet. &#x20;

Seed phrases are really important. Your seed phrase can NEVER be changed and if lost will equate to you losing access to both your account and your $Deso wallet.&#x20;

**Never share your seed phrase and make sure that access to the phrase is secured.**
