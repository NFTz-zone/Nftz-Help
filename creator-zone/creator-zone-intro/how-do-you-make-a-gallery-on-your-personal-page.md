# How do you make a gallery on your personal page?

On NFTz.me its possible to make your own galleries. This is very handy if you collect multiple NFTs and you want to show them seperately for each artist. You can have a Cloutpunk gallery and a Rowdy Reptilians gallery, etc. Creators that are interested in buying can see the NFTs which you own very easily. Its also possible to share the URL to a particular user-created gallery on social media by going to [How do you share galleries?](how-do-you-make-a-url-path-of-your-gallery-to-share-with-others.md)
